<h2> Why Charleston</h2>
<p>A Lot of people have asked us "Why Charleston?" So we thought we could give a little explaination.
<ul>
	<li>Firstly its where we met and first spent any decent length of time face to face </li>
	<li>Secondly, its a very pretty city so will satisfy those who are visiting from a country older than 200 years.</li>
	<li>Thirdly, it has a great atmosphere and vibe. Its somewhere we both love to visit and spend time</li>
</ul>

<h2>A bit of History</h2>
<p class="dropdown">Charleston is the oldest and second-largest city in the State of South Carolina. The city lies just south of the geographical midpoint of South Carolina's coastline and is located on Charleston Harbor, on the mouth of the Ashley and Cooper rivers.
Founded in 1670 as Charles Towne in honor of King Charles II of England, Charleston adopted its present name in 1783. By 1690, Charles Towne was the fifth largest city in North America,and it remained among the ten largest cities in the United States through until about 1840. <br />Known for its rich history, well-preserved architecture, distinguished restaurants, and mannerly people, Charleston has received a large number of accolades, including "America's Most Friendly City"  in 2013 by Cond√© Nast and also "the most polite and hospitable city in America" by Southern Living magazine.<br />Several Movies and Tv shows have been flimed in and around Charleston including, Dear John, The Notebook and Die Hard with a Vengeance. Charleston has a special place in our hearts and we hope you enjoy visiting it as much as we do.
